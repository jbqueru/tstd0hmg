ARE YOU READY?

THE MEGABUSTERS ARE BACK WITH A BRAND NEW CRACK!
WE ARE BRINGING YOU ANDROID FOR THE ATARI ST!!!?!
UNFORTUNATELY YOUR ST IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH:
YOU NEED AT LEAST A 68040 OR 68060 CPU AT 333MHZ,
160MB OF RAM, AND 500MB OF HDD.

GUEST MUSIC BY AD FROM MPS. GRAPHICS BY PANDAFOX FROM
THE MEGABUSTERS, CODE BY DJAYBEE FROM THE MEGABUSTERS.

THIS INTRO IS DEDICATED TO THE INNER CHILD IN EACH OF US,
THE ONE WHO DOES NOT WANT TO GROW UP, THE ONE WHO PREFERS
TO PLAY GAMES WITHOUT A CARE IN THE WORLD, THE ONE WHO
STILL CREATES DEMOS FOR A COMPUTER THAT BECAME OBSOLETE
DECADES AGO. GIVE YOUR INNER CHILD SOME SPACE TO BREATHE!

ENJOY THE PIXEL-EXACT KERNING ON THE PROPORTIONAL FONT,
ALONG WITH THE 3D CUBOCTAHEDRONS.
