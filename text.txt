Are you ready?

     The MegaBuSTers are back with a brand new crack!
We are giving you Android for the Atari ST!!!?!
Unfortunately your ST is not powerful enough: you need
at least a 68040 or 68060 CPU at 333MHz, 160MB of RAM,
and 500MB of HDD. Better luck next time, ha ha ha!

     Guest music by AD from MPS. Graphics by Pandafox from
the MegaBuSTers, code by Djaybee from the MegaBuSTers.

     This intro is dedicated to the inner child in each of us,
the one who does not want to grow up, the one who prefers
playing games without a care in the world, the one who
still creates demos for a computer that became obsolete
decades ago. Give your inner child some breathing space!

     Enjoy the pixel-exact kerning on the proportional font,
along with the 3D cuboctahedrons.

     This intro was released for the Fantasy Cracktro
Challenge, March 16th 2025. Major thanks to the
organizers for making it happen.

     This intro was inspired by a cracktro that VMAX had
created for some of their cracks, including Tip Off.
In memoriam, TST D0 from VMAX. R.I.P.
